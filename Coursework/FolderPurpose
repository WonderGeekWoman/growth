This folder serves as a storehouse for work from various courses that represent your strengths and learning. You should create subfolders in this folder. The name of the subfolders would be the classes the artifacts are from. Moving forward, make it a practice at the end of the semester to update this folder by adding new subfolders and artifacts.
